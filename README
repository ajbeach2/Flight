This is a simple OpenGL demo that demonstrates quaternion based rotations  
for flight mechanics.  This project also uses the GLUT library so you must have 
glut installed to run this as a Visual Studio project.   
There is an executable in the downloads section that was compiled 
on a x64 windows 7 machine.  This exe will only run if you have glut32.dll on your  
machine.
 
Here is a video of the program in action:

Source files: 
FlightSim.cpp (contains main) 
Quaternion.cpp 
Vector3D.cpp 
Vector3D.h 
Quaternion.h 
 
To install glut in windows: 
 
1. Download the glut binaries for windows.  They can be found at this link:  
http://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut/glut-3.7.6-bin.zip 
 
2.  Create a folder called  
'GL' in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\ 
copy glut.h to this folder.  The path of glut.h should be  
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\GL\glut.h 
 
3. Copy glut32.lib to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib 
 
4. Copy glut32.dll to your SysWOW64 or System32 depending on if you you are running 
32bit or 64bit windows. To be safe you can just copy it to both directories
